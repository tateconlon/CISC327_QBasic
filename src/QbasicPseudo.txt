Qbasic

run is a loop waiting for login
then agent or machine
Save that as the permission level
read in valid accounts file -> accounts variable: old & new (can't perform actions on new accounts)
then loop for command
	commands are functions where you pass in permission level
	if not permission level the break out of function while raising exception or adding to output???
	command functions are just waiting for valid input. invalid input breaks out
	command functions need to validate transfers????????? (can't do it! LOOK INTO BACKEND)
	command functions write to transcript file variable that is a list of lines
on 'logout'
write transaction file



write output file?

write valid accounts file? <- no, this is passed in, not written out


How to hand output to terminal and also to output file? Can you do that?
How to validate transfers? Look into back end -> I think we messed up, cannot validate on front end
How to error out.

failsafe: exit calls logout so everything gets printed
